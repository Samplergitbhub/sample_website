Humble Beginnings<br><br>

The journey to HackerRank first began in July 2009, when computer science graduates Vivek<br>
 and Hari worked at Amazon and IBM (respectively) for about a year in Bangalore. Both were<br> on
  interview panels, inundated with endless hours of resume reviews, phone screens, and onsite <br>
  interviews. Unqualified people were making it to the onsite, while some of their most capable,<br>
   hardworking friends were passed on because of their GPA or lack of a prestigious degree.<br><br>

Thats when they noticed a massive problem and opportunity in the technical recruiting system.<br>
 They quit their jobs to build InterviewStreet, a website that matched mentors with students. <br>
 Within a few weeks, hundreds of students signed up across a dozen universities. They received their<br>
  first cheque for 413.62 INR ($5.68). A copy exists in the Bangalore office and underneath, it says <br>
  “Humble Beginnings.”

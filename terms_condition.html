       <b class="c1"> What Are Terms and Conditions?</b><br>
        <br>

A terms and conditions agreement outlines the rules, expectations, and guidelines you expect people to follow when accessing your website or mobile app and informs them about what they can expect from you.

Whether you call it a terms of use, terms of service, or terms and conditions, this powerhouse document helps maintain control over your site as long as your guidelines fall within applicable laws.

Here are a few examples of what you can include in yours:

    Establish and clarify your intellectual property rights
    Limit your liabilities
    Outline your dispute resolution options
    Disclose your governing laws
    Establish payment terms
    Include shipping policy and return and refund details
    Inform users about your privacy policy
    Outline acceptable uses, prohibited behaviors, and their consequences

It answers several common customer service questions and provides clear protocols if users try to take advantage of your operations.
<br><br><b class="c2">Are Terms and Conditions Legally Required?</b><br>
<br>

No, terms and conditions agreements aren’t legally required, but it’s in your best interest to post one on your website or mobile app.

Not only is this standard practice across the world, but it also provides your site with an additional layer of legal protection.

While it’s not guaranteed to hold up in a court of law, in the event of a dispute, arbitrators may consider multiple facets of your T&C document to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Plus, according to the American Bar Association (ABA), some specific legal disclosures apply to certain types of transactions, which must be made as written statements that may apply to your business.

Those details belong as clauses in your terms and conditions agreement, like stipulations outlined by the following federal US laws:

    The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
    Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Terms and conditions may not be legally required, but privacy policies and cookie policies are.
